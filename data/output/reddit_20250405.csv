1jr68kn,Are Hyperscalers becoming more expensive in Europe due to the tariffs?,"Hi,

With the recent tariffs in mind, are cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud becoming more expensive for European companies? And what about other techs like Snowflake or Databricks – are they affected too?

Would it be wise for European businesses to consider open-source alternatives, both for cost and strategic independence?

And from a personal perspective: should we, as employees, expand our skill sets toward open-source tech stacks to stay future-proof?",33,0,28,Ok-Inspection3886,2025-04-04 07:31:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jr68kn/are_hyperscalers_becoming_more_expensive_in/,False,False,False,False
1jrua8r,How to spot “just do the work” teams at big tech companies during interviews,"Hey!

I’m looking for advice on Data Engineering careers.

In interviews, managers often promise high-impact projects, lots of autonomy, and fast growth. But once you’re in, you might end up stuck doing the same narrow task for years.

In my experience, embedded DE roles in big tech aren't well-positioned to proactively drive the kind of high-impact work needed for Senior/Staff levels because:

* The work is inherently support-focused, making it hard to take broad ownership or show clear impact
* Architectural decisions come from platform teams
* DS/Analytics teams often lead early investigations, and DEs are brought in late
* Managers are usually from DS / Analytics backgrounds, not engineering

In smaller companies, I had more room to blend embedded DE work (ETL, modeling) with platform responsibilities (architecture, tooling). But those companies pay less and lack big-name recognition.

I’m starting to think embedded DE roles are a dead end. Maybe I should focus on platform teams or pivot to a DE+ML role at a mid-sized company after some self-study.

1jramqt,"Airbyte Connector Builder now supports GraphQL, Async Requests and Custom Components","Hello, Marcos from the Airbyte Team.

For those who may not be familiar, Airbyte is an open-source data integration (EL) platform with over 500 connectors for APIs, databases, and file storage.

In our last release we added several new features to our no-code Connector Builder:

* [GraphQL Support](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/config-based/understanding-the-yaml-file/request-options#graphql-request-injection): In addition to REST, you can now make requests to GraphQL APIs (and properly handle pagination!)
* [Async Data Requests](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/connector-builder-ui/async-streams): There are some reporting APIs that do not return responses immediately. For instance, with Google Ads.  You can now request a custom report from these sources and wait for the report to be processed and downloaded.
* [Custom Python Code Components](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/connector-builder-ui/custom-components): We recognize that some APIs behave uniquely—for example, by returning records as key-value pairs instead of arrays or by not ordering data correctly. To address these cases, our open-source platform now supports custom Python components that extend the capabilities of the no-code framework without blocking you from building your connector.

We believe these updates will make connector development faster and more accessible, helping you get the most out of your data integration projects.

We understand there are discussions about the trade-offs between no-code and low-code solutions. At Airbyte, transitioning from fully coded connectors to a low-code approach allowed us to maintain a large connector catalog using standard components.  We were also able to create a better build and test process directly in the UI. Users frequently give us the feedback that the no-code connector Builder enables less technical users to create and ship connectors. This reduces the workload on senior data engineers allowing them to focus on critical data pipelines.

Something else that has been top of mind is speed and performance. With a robust and stable connector framework, the engineering team has been dedicating significant resources to introduce concurrency to enhance sync speed. You can read this[ blog post](https://airbyte.com/blog/improving-connector-sync-speed-up-to-10x-faster) about how the team implemented concurrency in the Klaviyo connector, resulting in a speed increase of about 10x for syncs.

I hope you like the news! Let me know if you want to discuss any missing features or provide feedback about Airbyte.",4,0,2,marcos_airbyte,2025-04-04 12:26:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jramqt/airbyte_connector_builder_now_supports_graphql/,False,False,False,False

However, for my project I don't need all the results to be showed together, perhaps after some hours/days. It would be much more useful to get a stream of the partial results in real time.

1jrm80y,Marketing Report & Fivetran,"Fishing for advice as I'm sure many have been here before. I came from DE at a SaaS company where I was more focused on the infra but now I'm in a role much close to the business and currently working with marketing. I'm sure this could make the Top-5 all time repeated DE tasks. A daily marketing report showing metrics like Spend, cost-per-click, engagement rate, cost-add-to-cart, cost-per-traffic... etc. These are per campaign based on various data sources like GA4, Google Ads, Facebook Ads, TikTok etc. Data updates once a day.

It should be obvious I'm not writing API connectors for a dozen different services. I'm just one person doing this and have many other things to do. I have Fivetran up and running getting the data I need but MY GOD is it ever expensive for something that seems like it should be simple, infrequent & low volume. It comes with a ton of build in reports that I don't even need sucking rows and bloating the bill. I can't seem to get what I need without pulling millions of event rows which costs a fortune to do.

Are there other similar but (way) cheaper solutions are out there? I know of others but any recommendations for this specific purpose?",2,0,7,bcsamsquanch,2025-04-04 20:45:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jrm80y/marketing_report_fivetran/,False,False,False,False
1jrd8po,PII Obfuscation in Databricks,"Hi Data Champs,

I have been recently given chance to explore PII obfuscation technique in databricks.

I proposed using sql aes_encryption or python fernet for PII column level encryption before landing to bronze.

And use column masking on delta tables which has built in logic for group membership check and decryption so to avoid the overhead of a new view per table.

My HDE was more interested in sql approach than the fernet but fernet offers built in key rotation out of the box.

Has anyone used aes_encryption 
Is it secure, easy to work with and relatively more robust.

From my experience for data type other than binary like long, int, double it needs to be first converted to binary (don’t like it)

Apart from that usual error here and there for padding and generic error when decrypting sometimes.

So given the choice what will be your architecture

1jrr1x9,Improving data entry quality over or in excel?,"The place I work, because of the industry and because of the age and experience of the folks working here, is basically married to manually-entered excel spreadsheets, some of which are eventually ingested (in an extremely byzantine way) into a SQL Server database. We are stuck in an Azure stack, and there are some scripts that are reading the contents of spreadsheets for ingestion.

The data has Problems, a lot of the time, which is, of course, because people are entering data in Excel by hand. Nothing is validated when folks save things; there are copy-paste errors. Some files are created by external consultants using templates we provide, and the quality is not great. There are parts of the workflow that are entirely redundant, like taking data that one person typed into a spreadsheet, saved as a pdf, and then copying it into a new spreadsheet by hand.

1jrc62b,Can you call an aimless star schema a data mart?,"So,

  
as always that's for the insight from other people, I find a lot of these discussions around points very entertaining and very helpful!

I'm having an argument with someone who is several levels above me. This might sound petty so I apologise in advance. It centres around the definition of a Mart. Our Mart is a single Fact with around 20 dimensions. The Fact is extremely wide and deep. Indeed we usually put it into a de normalised table for reporting. To me this isn't a MART as it isn't based on requirements but rather a star schema that supposedly servers multiple purposed or potential purposes. When engaged on requirements the person leans on there experience in the domain and says a user probable wants to do X, Y and Z. I've never seen anything written down. Constantly that report also defers to Kimball methodology and how this follows them closely. My take on the book is that these things need to be based of requirement, business requirements. 

My questions is, is it fair to say that a data mart needs to have requirements and ideally a business domain in mind or else its just a star schema?

Yes this  is  very theoretical... yes I probable need a hobby but look there hasn't been a decent RTS game in years and its friday!!!

I am due to begin an MSc in Computer Science & Business in September 2025 which covers some DE contents.

My dilemma is whether I should additionally pursue a part-time 2-year Applied Statistics MSc to give myself a better edge in the hiring process for DE roles.

I am aware DEs hardly ever use any stats but many people transition from DS/DA roles (which are stats-heavy) into DE, and that entry-level DE roles do not really exist, hence was wondering if I will need the background in stats to get my foot on the door (or path) by becoming a DA first and taking it from there.

For context, my bachelors was not in STEM and my job, whilst it requires some level of analytical thinking and numeracy, is not quantitative either.

The transformation was honestly pretty incredible to watch. Reports that used to take hours now run in seconds. Their analyst actually took a vacation for the first time in a year. And we got this really nice email from their CTO saying we'd ""changed how they make decisions"" which gave us all the warm fuzzies.
